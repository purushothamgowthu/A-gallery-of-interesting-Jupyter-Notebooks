Come join the leaders and contributors from the Jupyter Community in the free JupyterCon Community Sprint on Saturday, August 25, at the Hilton Midtown, sponsored by Bloomberg. 

During this “Open Studio”, you will work side-by-side with leaders and contributors of the Jupyter Project and related ecosystem to implement that feature you've always wanted, fix bugs, write documentation, test software, dive deep into the internals of a project, get started on a new project, or just learn how to get started to use or contribute to Open Source.

Attendees of all experience levels are welcome. We'll have a short introduction to the Github workflow for new contributors. It is recommended for attendees to bring their laptop.

Projects leaders coordinate the work on a project, help contributors, and suggest some items that would be great to work on. If you'd like to be a project leader, please contact the organisers:

  - Jason Grout  ( @jasongrout : Bloomberg, working on widgets, notebook, and JupyterLab)
  - Kyle Kelley ( @rgbkrk: Netflix, working on nteract, Hydrogen, notebook format, Jupyter protocols)
